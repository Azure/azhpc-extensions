To update the forward link, go to

https://redirectiontool.trafficmanager.net/am/redirection/home

switch domain to go.microsoft.com,

and modify the link for 

"FwLink" : "https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2175154"

This link should always point to corresponding DirLink, which itself points to latest driver version.
